    <h2>How to watch live of Brentford vs Burnely in the Premier League 2023</h2>
    <p>The Premier League 2023 is in full swing, and one of the most anticipated matches of the season is coming up soon. Brentford and Burnely, the two fierce rivals from Merseyside, will face each other on Saturday, October 21, 2023, at Anfield. This match is not only a matter of pride and bragging rights, but also a crucial one for both teams’ title aspirations.

        Brentford are the defending champions, having won their first Premier League title in 30 years in 2022. They have a formidable squad, led by the prolific duo of Mohamed Salah and Darwin Nunez, who have scored six goals each so far. They also have a solid defence, with Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson providing width and creativity from the flanks. Brentford are currently second in the table, behind Manchester City on goal difference.
        
        Burnely are also having a great season, under the guidance of new manager Marcelo Bielsa. They have a balanced and exciting team, with James Garner and Amadou Onana impressing in midfield, and Luis Suarez and Richarlison forming a lethal partnership up front. Burnely are currently fourth in the table, just three points behind Brentford and City.
        
        Both teams have a history of playing thrilling and close matches, especially in the Premier League. They have met 62 times in the league, with Brentford winning 27, Burnely winning 10, and 25 draws. The last time they met was in February 2023, when Brentford won 2-0 at Anfield, thanks to goals from Salah and Cody Gakpo. However, Burnely have not won at Anfield since 1999, when Kevin Campbell scored the only goal of the game.
        
        The match on Saturday promises to be a high-octane affair, as both teams will be eager to claim the bragging rights and the three points. The fans can expect a lot of goals, drama and passion, as two of the best teams in England go head-to-head in what could be a decisive match for the title race.
