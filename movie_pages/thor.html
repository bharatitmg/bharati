				<h3>Movie explained in words</h3>
				
<br>
				<p>
						Thor: Love and Thunder begins with Gorr the God Butcher, Christian Bale’s villain, stumbling through the desert with his dying daughter in his arms. He desperately prays to his God – the Bringer of Light – to save them, but to no avail. After his daughter dies in his arms, he follows a voice and encounters his God at what seems to be a gate to the afterlife. As Gorr tells him how he’s dedicated his life to worshiping him, it soon becomes clear his devotion has been wasted: there’ll be no eternal glory for him to enjoy. The Necrosword lying on the ground calls to the Gorr and he embraces its power, kills the God, and becomes the God Butcher. 

Meanwhile, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) has worked off his "sad bod" from Endgame and now goes around the universe kicking ass with the Guardians of the Galaxy. However, he soon parts ways with the group after Lady Sif sends him a distress call. Turns out, Gods are being killed everywhere, and Thor sets out to find out who is killing them – and he knows exactly where a God-killer would head next: New Asgard. He goes back to Earth, where Jane Foster now wields Mjolnir. Jane's been battling Stage 4 cancer and her treatment isn’t working. The astrophysicist realizes Mjolnir has healing qualities and heads to New Asguard, where she discovers she is worthy enough to become the Mighty Thor.Gorr attacks New Asgard with his army of shadow monsters, but fails to kill Thor and instead steals the Asgardian children and imprisons them in the Shadow Realm. Working with Heimdall's son, Thor figures out Gorr's plan and goes with, Valkyrie, Korg, and Jane to build an army of Gods to take down Gorr. In Omnipotence City, the maniacal Zeus refuses to help, but does reveal Gorr may be heading to the mythical place Eternity. There, he could make a wish and kill all Gods. That still doesn't phase Zeus, and Thor fights the God of Lightning, seemingly kills him, and steals Zeus' Lightning Bolt. Only Korg's head survives the battle.On the journey, Jane confides in Thor that she is dying of cancer and the pair reconcile. In the Shadow Realm, the color drains from the universe, and Jane soon realizes the whole thing's a trap: Gorr wants them there, as the key to opening Eternity is the Bifrost, which is accessed using Thor's axe Stormbreaker. It's too late, though, and Gorr takes the weapon and Valkyrie and Jane are both seriously hurt in the crossfire.

The Bifrost sends the trio back to New Asguard, where Jane's situation gets worse with Mjolnir draining her remaining energy. They decide Thor needs to take on Gorr, and he heads to Eternity. Thor manages to impart his powers onto the Asgardian children, and they fight the God Butcher and the shadow creatures. However, it's not quite enough, and Jane arrives to save the day. Thor retrieves Stormbreaker, sends the children home using the Bifrost, and they destroy Gorr's source of power the Necrosword. However, the gate to Eternity is fully open, and Gorr goes through...

Thor and Jane follow him through, and rather than fight Gorr, they offer him an alternative: why kill all the Gods, when he could wish for his daughter to return. The God Butcher says the young girl would have no one as he’s dying, but Jane tells him that isn’t true, looking at Thor. Gorr's daughter comes through the gate of Eternity, Gorr dies, Jane turns to stardust, and Thor adopts the girl. The duo head back to New Asguard, where King Valkyrie and Lady Sif are training up the children, Korg's found a boyfriend, Dwayne, and Thor and his adopted daughter fight side by side. Their superhero names? Love and Thunder.

But wait! There are two post-credits scenes to enjoy. The first reveals that Zeus is still alive, and he wants people to fear the Gods again – and Hercules, played by Ted Lasso’s Brett Goldstein, is the man for the job. The second post-credits scene takes us to Valhalla where Jane's greeted into eternal paradise by Idris Elba’s Heimdall.The most heartbreaking storyline in Thor: Love and Thunder is Jane Foster’s illness. Early on in the movie, we learn that the beloved scientist, and Thor’s ex-girlfriend, has been diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer. She’s in treatment with Darcy Lewis looking after her, but nothing is working. For a little while, it seems that maybe Mjolnir may be her savior, but it becomes clear it’s actually draining her of energy needed to fight the cancer, echoing the storyline in the Mighty Thor comics. 

At the end of the movie, Jane makes the decision to embrace becoming the Mighty Thor for one final time. She helps Thor get the Asgardian children home, but as soon as she returns to her human form, she dies in the God of Thunder’s arms. After telling Thor that she loves him, her body disappears into dust, in a similar fashion to Odin’s death back in Thor: Ragnarok. In the post-credits scene, it’s confirmed that she’s dead, when she’s welcomed into Valhalla by Heimdall. Natalie Portman could return in the future for a similar kind of afterlife scene, but it seems likely this is the end for her character in the MCU.Early on in the movie, when Thor is speaking to Sif, he explains the rules about getting into Valhalla. The afterlife of the gods only permits entry to warriors who die in battle. Jane is fatally wounded when she is in her Mighty Thor form battling Gorr at the gate of Eternity. Plus, when she becomes the Mighty Thor, she takes on Asgardian powers, and as an Asgardian, she's granted entry to the afterlife.Thor and the Mighty Thor destroy Gorr’s Necrosword, which is what gave him his God butchering powers. Without it, he reverts back to his dying, human form as it has taken too much of his energy from him. So when Gorr stumbles through the gates of Infinity, he is already close to death. It isn’t long before he succumbs to it. When Thor and the gang head to Omnipotence City, Zeus explains Gorr’s plans to reach Eternity and make the wish for all Gods to die. However, when Gorr actually reaches Eternity, he makes a different choice. He instead decides to bring his daughter back from the dead. After the Necrosword – a corrupting force – is destroyed, it seems Gorr is less intent on his mission to kill Gods, and with Thor and Jane showing the power of love, Gorr sees that his daughter could have another life with them.Thor has a daughter (kind of). Gorr asks Eternity to bring back his daughter to life as Thor becomes her caretaker. In the final scene of the movie, we see the pair living in domestic bliss on a ship. The moment is full of adorable details: Thor is making breakfast while the young girl has drawn a face on Mjolnir. We don’t see where exactly they are but when the door opens, the pair run out into battle somewhere. 

We learn that Thor and Gorr’s daughter are called "Love and Thunder". Korg doesn’t make it clear who is who, but Chris Hemsworth seemingly gave this away in an interview ahead of the movie’s release. Speaking to Kevin McCarthy(opens in new tab), he shared that his daughter, India Rose Hemsworth, plays the character. "My daughter is there too," he said, "she plays the character of Love."

However, he also revealed that the young Hemsworth may not be returning in the role beyond the movie. Hemsworth added: "It felt like a one-off fun family experience. I don’t want them to now go and become child stars and actors. It was just a special experience for that and they loved it, they had a great time."
